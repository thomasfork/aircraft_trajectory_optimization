# Example Videos

Below are several videos which animate raceline trajectories computed for https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07262

Disclaimer: to limit clutter, only one trajectory is visualized per video. Videos correspond in order to the three example scenarios from the publication https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07262
