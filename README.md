# aircraft_trajectory_optimization
Python scripts for high fidelity raceline trajectory optimization of aircraft.

This repository is currently a placeholder, and source code will be added to accompany the final manuscript (currently under review). Currently it houses several example videos of trajectories presented in the same manuscript.

You may find a preprint publication here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07262

## Citing

You are welcome to cite the preprint version of our paper, however in all likelihood it will be updated along with the final version of the manuscript. At that time we will update this repository, including a reference to the final version.


# Example Videos

Below are several videos which animate raceline trajectories computed for https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07262

Disclaimer: to limit clutter, only one trajectory is visualized per video. Videos correspond in order to the three example scenarios from the publication https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07262
